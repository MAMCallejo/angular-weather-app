# Angular Weather App

Web application showcasing a simple weather search. Built with Angular 14 and Tailwind CSS.

The app uses mock-data, so do not take it a source of truth for your next trip outside! :D


## Steps to run the app

1. If do not have NPM and Angular CLI installed already, do so by following these links: [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) & [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli). 

2. Run `npm install` to fetch all the node packages used by the app.

3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

4. (optional) Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

5. (optional) Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Reflection

Tailwind CSS together with Angular 14 make it easy to implement responsive, pixel-accurate web applications. The biggest challenges I encountered with this example application were figuring out how to make the most out of the Tailwind CSS classes and how to achieve full responsiveness across all device sizes. Thanks to these challenges I can now take with me the knowledge of a powerful new CSS framework that I will continue using over others like Boostrap.
