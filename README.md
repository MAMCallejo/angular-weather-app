# Angular Weather App

Web application showcasing a simple weather search. Built with Angular 14 and Tailwind CSS.

The app uses mock-data, so do not take it a source of truth for your next trip outside! :D


## Steps to run the app

1. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

2. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

3. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
